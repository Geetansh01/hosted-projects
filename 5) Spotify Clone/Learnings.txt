What i learnt after watching soln vdo:

1)Was unable to change svg color using CSS
>As the SVGs are by default black, use "filter: invert(1);" 

2)Was unable to implement responsive height for ".library-actions" & ".sidebar" as a whole
>

3)A cool trick to capture "mouseenter:mouseleave" type events:
> setTimeout(() => {debugger;}, 5000)

4)Difference between currentTarget and target property in JavaScript events
"target" = element that triggered event.
"currentTarget" = element that has the event listener.
